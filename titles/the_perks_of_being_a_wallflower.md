### Pages 1-6 Observations

> "So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both Happy and Sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be." — Charlie

The book starts with a letter from Charlie, dated August 25, 1991. He sounds very sad and frustrated, grappling with the suicide of his best friend, Michael. It feels like Charlie feels betrayed that Michael left without saying goodbye. from his letter, I can tell Charlie is one of those guys that remain silent even if a bomb dropped in front of him—quiet and awkward.

I relate to Charlie a lot because I am also quiet, shy, and socially awkward. But contrary to my initial impression of him as the silent type, he actually yelled and cried when the guidance counselor asked about Michael.


**Family Context:**
- Charlie is the youngest, with an older brother and sister.
- Aunt Helen (mother's sister) was his favorite person, but something happened to her.
- His father is dismissive of Charlie's inquiries about her, even slapping him once for "hurting Aunt Helen's feelings."
- His mother eventually revealed what happened after some wine, but Charlie forgot to include it in the letter due to tiredness.
