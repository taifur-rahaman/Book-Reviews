## Personal Notes & Observations

I've just started reading this modern classic, and I'm already feeling pulled into Charlie's world.

### Pages 1-6 Observations

> "So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both Happy and Sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be." — Charlie, p. 2

The book kicks off with a letter from Charlie dated August 25, 1991. He sounds incredibly heavy-hearted and frustrated, trying to process the suicide of his best friend, Michael. It almost feels like Charlie is grappling with a deep sense of betrayal—like Michael just left without giving him a chance to say goodbye. Reading his letter, I get the vibe that Charlie is the kind of quiet, awkward guy who would stay dead silent even if a bomb went off right next to him.

I actually relate to him a lot on that front, being someone who is also naturally quiet, shy, and socially awkward myself. But strangely enough, contrary to that first impression of him just being the "silent type," he totally broke down—yelling and crying—when the guidance counselor tried to talk to him about Michael. It shows there’s a lot bubbling under the surface.

**Family Context:**
- Charlie is the youngest kid in the family, with an older brother and sister.
- His Aunt Helen (his mom's sister) was his absolute favorite person in the world, but clearly, something happened to her.
- His dad completely brushes off Charlie whenever he brings her up, even going as far as slapping him once for "hurting Aunt Helen's feelings." 
- His mom eventually spilled some details after having a bit of wine, but Charlie was too wiped out to actually put it in the letter.

### Pages 16-18 Observations

> "My dad does not like to go to the cemetery because it gives him the creeps but I don't mind going at all because my aunt Helen is buried here." — Charlie, p. 16

Wow, okay. Aunt Helen passed away.

> "I walk to the kitchen and I saw my dad making a sandwich and crying he was crying harder than my even my mom and I couldn't believe it. When he finished making his sandwich he put away the things in the refrigerator and stop crying and wipe his eyes and saw me. Then, he walked up, patted my shoulder and said 'this is our little secret, okay, champ?'" — Charlie, p. 17

### Pages 17-29 Observations

> "We accept the love we think we deserve." — Bill (The English Professor), p. 17

> "The thing some girls think they can actually change guys and what's funny is that if they actually change them they get bored they'd have no challenge left. You just have to give girl some time to think of a new way of doing things, that's all. Some of them will figure it out here, some later, some never. I wouldn't worry about it too much." — Patrick, p. 23

Charlie is this 15-year-old kid just trying to figure life out, dealing with all the usual nervous and awkward energy that comes with it. He’s writing these letters about his day-to-day life and interactions to me—a total stranger he knows nothing about.

Honestly, I can really relate to Charlie. Up to this point (around page 29), almost everything he does or thinks about are things I’ve either done or at least seriously considered. For example, he mentions confessing to the girl he’s crushing on (Sam) that he saw her naked in his dream. I actually did something similar with my crush! The big difference is that Sam handled it surprisingly well, whereas Proma got really offended by my honesty. 

There's so much more I’m finding relatable about Charlie, but I feel like I'll be unpacking all of that slowly, exactly the way he does with his letters.
