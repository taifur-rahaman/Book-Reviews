## 📖 About

Rick Riordan is an American author best known for his mythological fantasy novels aimed at young adult and middle-grade readers. Before becoming a full-time writer, he spent fifteen years teaching English and social studies in public and private middle schools across California and Texas. His teaching background deeply informs his writing — accessible, fast-paced, and designed to pull in reluctant readers.

His experience with his son Haley, who was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, directly inspired the character of Percy Jackson — a boy whose "learning differences" are reframed in the story as gifts of demigod nature. This personal touch is part of what makes the Percy Jackson series resonate so deeply with young readers.

Riordan's career began with adult mystery fiction before he pivoted to mythology-infused YA fantasy — a pivot that would make him one of the bestselling authors in the world.

## ✍️ Writing Style

- **First-person narration**: Most of his YA novels are written in a close first-person voice, placing the reader directly inside the protagonist's head. This creates an immediately intimate and engaging reading experience.
- **Humour**: His prose is laced with wit, sarcasm, and comic timing. The humour feels organic to the character rather than performative — a key reason readers of all ages connect with his books.
- **Fast-paced plotting**: Riordan excels at momentum. His chapters are short, cliffhangers are frequent, and the pacing rarely lets up.
- **Mythology woven into modernity**: His signature approach — taking ancient mythological systems (Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Norse) and embedding them seamlessly into the modern world — is both his greatest creative achievement and the quality that makes his books feel fresh and endlessly rereadable.
- **Diverse, memorable characters**: His casts are carefully constructed — characters often serve thematic purposes while remaining entirely human in how they feel and behave.
- **Series architecture**: Riordan is a master of the long game — planting seeds, building prophecies, and delivering payoffs across multiple books that feel genuinely earned.
